JavaScript game

Game is written in Vanilla JavaScript and, 
I must admit, I didn’t test it in all major browsers and versions so some problems are possible, depending on your browser. 
It definitely works fine in FF and Chrome, and you’re definitely gonna have some problems in IE. 
Many thanks to James Long for his basic game framework (http://jlongster.com/Making-Sprite-based-Games-with-Canvas).
